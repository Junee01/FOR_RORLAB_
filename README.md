This File is 'ko.yml' for Rails users.
- Rails 4 + devise gem

All English were translated to Korea.

But not all conditions were handled so if you have a problem to use this .yml file, please contact to me and you can find standard ko.yml file at https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n#rails-locale-data-repository.

Thank you.
